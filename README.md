# Turing-Machine
This is a personal project between Bill Zhang and myself. The goal is to create a physical Turing Machine using 3D printing, an Arduino, and multicolor LEDs to represent the tape. Programmed in C++. A TM-Parser will also be created to provide a way to describe the Turing Machine states and transitions.
